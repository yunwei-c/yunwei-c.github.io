Welcome!
<br>
<br>
 I am a PhD student in the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working on Federated Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Student Modeling with <a href="https://www.cbrinton.net/">Dr. Christopher Brinton</a>. 
I have also had the opportunity to actively collaborate with <a href="https://people.umass.edu/~andrewlan/index.html">Dr. Andrew Lan</a>, <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Academics/Graduate/People/Faculty/ptProfile?resource_id=79518">Dr. Kerrie Douglas</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/seyyedalihosseinalipour">Dr. Seyyedali Hosseinali</a>.
My current research focuses on (1) understanding the possibility of Federated Learning in the multi-lingual scenario and (2) mitigating prediction biases for under-represented minorities in student modeling. During my PhD study, I have had the pleasure of doing my research internship at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>, where I was fortunate to work on entity-centric headline generation.

<br>
<br>  
Before joining Purdue, I was a a full-time NLP research assistant in <a href="https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io/">Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab</a> at Academia Sinica supervised by  <a href="https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/">Dr. Lun-Wei Ku</a>. My research at NLPSA included vision-to-language projects, such as visual storytelling and video question answering. Prior to that, I got a masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Control Engineering at National Chiao Tung University and did graduate research with <a href="http://cssplab.cn.nctu.edu.tw/adviser/advisor.php">Prof. Bing-Fei Wu</a> on image-based heart rate detection.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you!

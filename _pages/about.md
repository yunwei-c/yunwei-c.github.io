Welcome!
<br>
<br>
 I am a PhD student in the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working on Federated Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Student Modeling with <a href="https://www.cbrinton.net/">Dr. Christopher Brinton</a>. 
I have also had the opportunity to actively collaborate with <a href="https://people.umass.edu/~andrewlan/index.html">Dr. Andrew Lan</a>, <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Academics/Graduate/People/Faculty/ptProfile?resource_id=79518">Dr. Kerrie Douglas</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/seyyedalihosseinalipour">Dr. Seyyedali Hosseinali</a>.
My current research focuses on (1) understanding the possibility of Federated Learning in the multi-lingual scenario and (2) mitigating prediction biases for under-represented minorities in student modeling.


I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Purdue University under supervision of <a href="https://www.cbrinton.net/">Prof. Christopher Brinton</a>. My current research focuses on video-watching clickstream analysis which aims to identify learners' behavior from MOOC dataset. My research interests span machine learning and deep learning method including but not limited to Natural Language Process, Computer Vision and Multi-modal processing. 
<br>
<br>  
Before joining Purdue, I was a research assistant in <a href="https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io/">Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab</a> at Academia Sinica supervised by  <a href="https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/">Dr. Lun-Wei Ku</a>. My research at NLPSA included vision-to-language projects, such as visual storytelling and video question answering. Prior to that, I got a masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Control Engineering at National Chiao Tung University and did graduate research with <a href="http://cssplab.cn.nctu.edu.tw/adviser/advisor.php">Prof. Bing-Fei Wu</a> on image-based heart rate detection.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you!

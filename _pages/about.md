Welcome!
<br>
<br>
I am a PhD student in the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cbrinton.net/">Dr. Christopher Brinton</a>.  
My research interests include natural language processing (vision-to-language applications and human-preferred language generation/evaluation), machine learning (fairness and reliability in distributed ML), and AI applications for social good. 
During my PhD studies, I interned at <a href="https://www.nec-labs.com/">NEC Labs</a>, where I worked on reducing hallucination in multimodal LLMs for healthcare scenarios, and at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>, focusing on entity-centric news headline generation.

<br>
<br>  
Before joining Purdue, I was a a full-time NLP research assistant in <a href="https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io/">Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab</a> at Academia Sinica supervised by  <a href="https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/">Dr. Lun-Wei Ku</a>. My research at NLPSA included vision-to-language projects, such as visual storytelling and video question answering. Prior to that, I got a masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Control Engineering at National Chiao Tung University and did graduate research with <a href="http://cssplab.cn.nctu.edu.tw/adviser/advisor.php">Prof. Bing-Fei Wu</a> on image-based heart rate detection.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you!

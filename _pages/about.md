Welcome!

I am a research assistant in [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io/)  at Academia Sinica supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). My current research focuses on vision-to-language projects, such as visual storytelling and video question answering. My research interests span machine learning and deep learning method including but not limited to Natural Language Process, Computer Vision and Recommendation System.

Previously I spent great years at National Chiao Tung University working with [Prof. Bing-Fei Wu](http://cssplab.cn.nctu.edu.tw/adviser/advisor.php) on image-based heart rate detection.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you!

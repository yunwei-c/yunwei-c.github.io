I am a PhD student in the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Purdue University, under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Brinton. I am broadly interested in natural language processing (vision-to-language applications and efficient language modeling), machine learning (federated learning and meta-learning), and AI applications for social good. My current research centers around: (1) observing insights into pre-training and initialization for federated learning, (2) understanding the possibility of federated learning in the multi-lingual scenario, and (3) mitigating prediction biases for under-represented minorities in student modeling. During my PhD study, I have had the pleasure of doing my research internship at Microsoft Research, where I was fortunate to work on entity-centric headline generation.

Welcome!

I am a PhD student in the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Purdue University, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cbrinton.net/">Dr. Christopher Brinton</a>. 
I am broadly interested in natural language processing (vision-to-language applications and efficient language modeling), machine learning (federated learning and meta-learning), and AI applications for social good. 
My current research centers around: (1) observing insights into pre-training and initialization for federated learning, (2) understanding the possibility of federated learning in the multi-lingual scenario, and (3) mitigating prediction biases for under-represented minorities in student modeling. 
During my PhD study, I have had the pleasure of doing my research internship at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>, where I was fortunate to work on entity-centric headline generation.

<br>  
Before joining Purdue, I was a a full-time NLP research assistant in <a href="https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io/">Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab</a> at Academia Sinica supervised by  <a href="https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/">Dr. Lun-Wei Ku</a>. My research at NLPSA included vision-to-language projects, such as visual storytelling and video question answering. Prior to that, I got a masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Control Engineering at National Chiao Tung University and did graduate research with <a href="http://cssplab.cn.nctu.edu.tw/adviser/advisor.php">Prof. Bing-Fei Wu</a> on image-based heart rate detection.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you!

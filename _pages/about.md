Welcome!

I am a research assistant in [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io/)  at Academia Sinica supervised by Dr. Lun-Wei Ku. My current research focuses on vision-to-language projects, such as visual storytelling and video question answering. My research interests span machine learning and deep learning method including but not limited to Natural Language Process, Computer Vision and Recommendation System.

Before joining NLPSA Lab, I got a masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Control Engineering at National Chiao Tung University and did graduate research with Prof. Bing-Fei Wu on image-based heart rate detection.

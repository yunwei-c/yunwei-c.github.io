<b>Luminance Variation Resistant Remote-PPG</b>
<br>Collected drivers’ facial dataset (2.7M continuous images) in different outdoor scenarios, including day time and night. Developed an Adaptive Neural Network Model Selection algorithm to eliminate facial luminance variation noise from rPPG signal and  successfully reduced the mean absolute error from 14.71 bpm to 4.51 bpm.

<b>Motion Robust Remote-PPG </b>
<br>Built a face tracking algorithm to extract heart rate signal from driver’s face in continuous images sequence. Developed machine learning approach to eliminate rPPG noise. This work is first of its kind as the traditional rPPG work consider only in indoor environment.

<b>Multiview Items Recommendation</b>
<br>Developed a GNN-based recommendation model which provides superior recommendations by describing items from a unique mixed view from user and entity angles. From the user view, user-oriented modules aggregate features to make recommendations from a personalized perspective. From the entity view, the mixing layer contrasts layer-wise GCN information to further obtain comprehensive features from internal entity-entity interactions. This work significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and indeed captures entities that attract users.

<b>Stage-Wise Training for GNN-based Recommender Model</b>
<br>Applied stage-wise training on two state-of-the-art recommendation models, RippleNet and Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), and evaluated the performance on six real world datasets. The result of the experiments shows that stage-wise training strategy can help both models to collect more information from the KG and improve the recommendation performance.

<b>Luminance Variation Resistant Remote-PPG</b>
<br>Collected drivers’ facial dataset (2.7M continuous images) in different outdoor scenarios, including day time and night. Developed an Adaptive Neural Network Model Selection algorithm to eliminate facial luminance variation noise from rPPG signal and  successfully reduced the mean absolute error from 14.71 bpm to 4.51 bpm.

<b>Motion Robust Remote-PPG </b>
<br>Built a face tracking algorithm to extract heart rate signal from driver’s face in continuous images sequence. Developed machine learning approach to eliminate rPPG noise. This work is first of its kind as the traditional rPPG work consider only in indoor environment.
